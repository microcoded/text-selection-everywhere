# text-selection-everywhere
Stop websites from blocking text selection â€“ copy and paste away!



## Installation Instructions
- Install Tampermonkey for your browser (or another userscript manager).
- Click [here](https://github.com/microcoded/text-selection-everywhere/raw/main/Text%20Selection%20Everywhere.user.js) and press install.

### Limitations
This userscript does not stop websites from preventing text selection with JavaScript. I have not found a way to do this that does not break functionality of websites which rely on custom mouse click functions.
